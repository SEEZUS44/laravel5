Usage Examples
For a basic workflow, you can use the "git add" command to stage changes for the next commit. The actual commit command will then wrap up the mentioned changes in a new commit object:

git add index.html css/styles.css
git commit -m "Change titles and styling on homepage"
If you have lots of changed files in your working copy - and want all of them included in the next commit - you can make use of the "-a" parameter and thereby omit the "git add" step:

git commit -a -m "Change titles and styling on homepage"
The "--amend" option comes in handy, for example, when you mistyped the last commit's message or forgot to add a change. The following example will correct the very last commit by overwriting its message and adding another change:

git add forgotten-change.js
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
